/**
 * Any information about the robot's current status should be accessed through the superstructure.
 * This class can be thought of as an interface for getting high-level data about the robot 
 * as well as high-level methods for controlling components of the robot that interact with 
 * eachother. 
 * 
 * ex. An elevator and arm could be both controlled with a setIntakeKinematicPosition(x,y);
 * this function would then follow the correct set of states to get the job done. To move the elevator,
 * it might call a setSetpoint(), then a feed() untill the error is within the threshold. This could be checked with a 
 * isAtThreshold()
 * 
 * This file is in the subsystem packge so that it can access protected information from each subsystem.
 * 
 * This is a state machine
